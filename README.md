This project is an end-to-end system that uses OpenWebNinja API to retrieve job listings based off parameters defined by the user, these parameters being: role, uk_location, date_posted, hybrid_or_remote, and employment_types. It retrieves these job listings that is then used to prompt a GPT-4o-mini model deployed through Microsoft Azure, prompting the model to generate a project list based off the qualifications of the user-relevant job roles that are currently in the UK market. This can be expanded through a "show evidence" button which extracts the job listings that were used to produce the project list. Users will also be able to retrieve previously defined parameters.
